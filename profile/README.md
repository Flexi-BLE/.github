# FlexiBLE: A Platfrom for Free Living Wearable Development

[![Demo YouTube Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/g7ES4XcpsuU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7ES4XcpsuU)

## Introduction
Real-world Data collection and analysis is a significant pain point in wearable device development, requiring multidisciplinary skills in: embedded systems, application development, data science, and domain expert knowledge. 

FlexiBLE utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy and an adaptive mobile application to help researchers quickly test new hardware, collect meaningful data, and assist in developing embedded algorithms with minimal intermediary code changes.

## Getting Started
FlexiBLE is in it's early stages of development. The best way to get involved is to reach out directly as we stablize the toolkit for a Beta release, please feel free to contract [Blaine Rothrock](https://blainerothrock.com). Otherwise, please visit the following in order:
* [HASCA '22 Presentation](https://blainerothrock.com): Overview of the platfrom
  * and the [coorespondng paper](https://blainerothrock.com) for me information
* [Zephyr and nRF5340 Dev Kit Sample Firmware](https://github.com/Flexi-BLE/flexible-zephyr-example)
* [iOS Application](https://github.com/Flexi-BLE/flexible-ios)
